# Overview
A city-based delivery service needs to optimize its delivery routes to minimize the total distance traveled. The delivery consists of a vehicle,  with a limited capacity. Delivery locations are distributed throughout the city.

# Objectives 
- **Analyze the Problem :**
  <br> Minimize total distance traveled by all delivery vehicles.
- **Optimize Routes :**
  <br> Use appropriate algorithmic techniques to suggest optimal routes.
- **Prove Correctness :**
  <br> Provide arguments or proofs demonstrating the efficiency and correctness of the suggested routes.
- **Minimize Costs :**
  <br> Ensure that the algorithm minimizes distance traveled.

# Algorithm Specification
